# GameJam

## Requierments 
Create a small top down 2d escape game, with around 5 minutes of gameplay.

## Scope 
We aim to make an escape game, the user will be placed in a maze where they have to find all the pickups to unlock the maze and escape.
The user will only see an orb of light around them, as they get more pickups the orb of light will grow larger making visibilty easier.
